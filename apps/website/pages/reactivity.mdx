title: Wox Inject â€“ Reactivity
---

# Wox Inject is not state management

Reactive bindings are currently not part of the library. Wox Inject behaves more similar to the React context API than to any other state manager. It only allows you to drive your application logic sepperated from your view logic and intertwin them in a very controlled way.

If you want to include reactivity in your application we recommend using [Preact signals](https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/signals/). It works surprisingly very well with Wox Inject.
> Signals are reactive primitives for managing application state.

```tsx
import { Injectable } from '@wox-team/wox-inject';
import { signal } from '@preact/signals-react';

@Injectable()
class Controller {
	counterState = signal(0);
	double = computed(() => this.counterState.value * 2);

	incriment() {
		this.counter.value++;
	}
}

function Counter() {
  const controller = useResolve(Controller);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {double.counterState}</p>
      <p>Double: {double.viewModel}</p>
      <button onClick={() => controller.incriment()}>click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
