### Issue with vite

Vite bundles with esbuild, which doesn't support emitting metadata for decorators.
This means that decorators like `@Injectable()` won't work as expected.

So without any additional work, the metadata won't be extracted from the source code.
Making any resolve call for deep injected dependacies be `undefined`.

It makes example like this not work as expected:

```tsx
import { Injectable, useResolve } from '@wox-team/wox-inject';

@Injectable()
class B {
	data = 'my data';
}

@Injectable()
class A {
	constructor(private b: B) {}
}

function App() {
	const a = useResolve(A);

	//             b will be undefined here.
	return <div>{a.b.data}</div>
}
```

It's missing the metadata that's required to resolve the dependacy. That being:
```tsx
Injectable.naughtyReflection(B, []);
Injectable.naughtyReflection(A, [B]);
```

### Adding the plugin
The above lines are possible to add manually, but that becomes a bit tedious after a while.
So we've created a vite plugin that does this for you.

```bash copy
pnpm add @wox-team/wox-inject-vite
```

Once installed, add it to your vite config:

```tsx filename="vite.config.ts" {2,7}
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config';
import { dependencyInjection } from '@wox-team/wox-inject-vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

export default defineConfig({
	plugins: [
		dependencyInjection(),
		react({
			babel: {
				parserOpts: {
					plugins: ['decorators-legacy'],
				},
			},
		}),
	],
});
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
	You might have also noticed that we've added `decorators-legacy` to the babel parser options.
	This is because vite uses babel to parse the source code, and it doesn't support decorators by default.
	So we'll need to add it to React's babel config.
