  __Note__

	Right now Vite is the only bundler that has a plugin that supports automatic of dependencies being injected.

To use the dependency injection system in React you need to install the `@wox-team/wox-inject` package.

```bash copy
pnpm add @wox-team/wox-inject
```

Once installed you can use the `useResolve` hook to inject a dependency into your component:

```tsx
import { Injectable } from '@wox-team/wox-inject';

@Injectable()
class MyService {
	greet() {
		return 'Hello World!';
	}
}

function App() {
	const myService = useResolve(MyService);

	return <div>{myService.greet()}</div>;
}
```

At this level of complexity it's not really worth it to use dependency injection, but as your application grows it will become more and more useful.


## A way of visualizing

To help visualize how dependency injection works, you can image a simple application that want to share applicatin state between components.

<picture>
	<source srcSet='/containers-1-dark.png' media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" />
	<Image
		src='/containers-1.png'
		alt=''
		width={1024}
		height={500}
	/>
</picture>

With no additional scoping, all resolved injections will be accessible from the "global container".

#### Scoped dependencies
This changes when scoping is introduced. When a dependency is scoped, it will only be accessible from the scope it was defined in.

<picture>
	<source srcSet='/containers-2-dark.png' media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" />
	<Image
		src='/containers-2.png'
		alt=''
		width={1024}
		height={500}
	/>
</picture>
