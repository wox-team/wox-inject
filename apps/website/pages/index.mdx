<p class="text-lg mt-4">An open-source library that enables dependency injection in React applications.</p>

## Getting Started
A quick tutorial to get you up and running with Wox Inject.

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
	Before continuing do note that Wox Inject __only__ works with __[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)__ right now. We are working on adding support for other build tools.
</Callout>

### Installation
Install the Wox Inject library using your favorite package manager.

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm add @wox-team/wox-inject
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash
    npm install @wox-team/wox-inject
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn add @wox-team/wox-inject
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>


### Usage
Once installed you can start using Wox Inject in your React application.

```tsx
import { Injectable } from '@wox-team/wox-inject';

@Injectable()
class GreeterService {
  greet(val: string) {
    console.log(val);
  }
}

function App() {
  const greeterService = useResolve(GreeterService);

  return (
    <button type="button" onClick={() => greeterService.greet('hello!')}>click me</button>
  );
}
```

The basic example above isn't very useful, but it demonstrates how to use Wox Inject in your application in a foundational way.

Let's jump into some more advanced topics and why you're using this!

#### Decorators
In Wox Inject the `@Injectable` decorator is used to define a class as a dependency to be resolved. The `useResolve` hook is used to resolve the service in a component.

```tsx
@Injectable()
class GreeterService {
  greet(val: string) {
    console.log(val);
  }
}

@Injectable()
class Controller {
  constructor(private greeterService: GreeterService) {}

  sayHello() {
    this.greeterService.greet('hello!');
  }
}
```

#### Reflection
At this step, trying to resolve `Controller` will result in an error.
```tsx
const controller = useResolve(Controller);
controller.sayHello() // TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'this.greeterService.greet')
```

This is because no code reflection has been done yet. What is code reflection?

Code reflection allows a program to examine and modify its own structure at runtime. TypeScript lacks built-in reflection, so developers often use `reflect-metadata` to attach and inspect metadata on classes and methods at runtime.

While that route would work for build tools that bundle the code through TypeScript, it'll not work for build tools that strips out type annontations like Vite.

To fix this, you'll need to add the `@wox-team/wox-inject-vite` plugin to your Vite configuration. It'll not work like traditional reflection that operates at runtime, but the plugin will generate metadata at build time.

To install the plugin, use your favorite package manager.

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm add @wox-team/wox-inject-vite -D
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash
    npm install @wox-team/wox-inject-vite -D
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn add @wox-team/wox-inject-vite -D
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

Once installed, add the plugin to your Vite configuration.

```tsx
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import { dependencyInjection } from '@wox-team/wox-inject-vite';

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  plugins: [
    // ...
    dependencyInjection(),
  ],
});
```

You will also need to add the `decorators-legacy` plugin to the Babel configuration in the react plugin.

```tsx
// ...
plugins: [
  react({
    babel: {
      parserOpts: {
        plugins: ['decorators-legacy'],
      },
    },
  }),
  dependencyInjection(),
],
// ...
```

Now you can run your application and the dependency injection will work as expected.

```tsx
const controller = useResolve(Controller);
controller.sayHello() // hello!
```

Happy building!

      open

    </details>
  )
}

<FAQBox title="Is Wox Inject a state managment package?">
  No, Wox Inject have more in common with React's Context API than with state management libraries. Wox Inject allows a composition of logic to be shared across components.

  You can read more about this in the [Reactivity](/reactivity) section.
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="Can I use Wox Inject without TypeScript">
  While it's technically possible to use Wox Inject without TypeScript. It's not at all recommended. Wox Inject is designed to work with TypeScript and you'll have a much better experience using it with TypeScript.
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="Can I use Wox Inject with Next.js?">
  No, not right now. Wox Inject is designed to work with React but currently we only support Vite as a build tool.
